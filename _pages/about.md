Hi! My name is Chendi Qian. I am a Ph.D. student at RWTH Aachen University, supervised by [Prof. Dr. Christopher Morris](https://chrsmrrs.github.io/). Previously I earned my Master of Science degree from the Technical University of Munich, under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Stephan Günnemann](https://www.professoren.tum.de/guennemann-stephan). Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor of Engineering at Zhejiang University, with my thesis supervised by [Prof. Dr. Ronghao Zheng](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=LxgdmqYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am particularly interested in the field of graph machine learning, encompassing both its theoretical foundations and practical applications.
